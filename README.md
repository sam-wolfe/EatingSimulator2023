â€‹A QWOP-like game about your favorite activity. Stuffing your face.

I did this for my first game jam, which was an overnight in person jam in my city. Had about 12 hours to work on it, so I skimped on the art a little. I wanted to make a game in the style of QWOP/Surgeon Sim- A game that is just as much fun with friends to watch, as play. Actually more fun to watch, because playing is awful, but the motivation is purely to do better than your friends did.
